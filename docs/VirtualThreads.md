Introduced in JDK 21.

Cheap and fast to create in large quantities. Virtual thread is mounted on platform thread (carrier thread).

Virtual threads are lightweight threads that reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and debugging high-throughput
concurrent applications.

Virtual threads take up very little memory because the JVM manages their stack. When we create a virtual thread it needs
very little memory because the stack can grow inside the heap as needed.

At a high level, a thread is managed and scheduled by the operating system, while a virtual thread is managed and
scheduled by a virtual machine. Now, to create a new kernel thread, we must do a system call, and thatâ€™s a costly
operation.

Mounting / unmounting allows scheduling of many virtual threads on a limited number of carrier threads.

`newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor` - Creates an Executor that starts a new virtual Thread for each task. The number of
threads created by the Executor is unbounded.

Virtual threads are always daemon threads and ignore priority.
